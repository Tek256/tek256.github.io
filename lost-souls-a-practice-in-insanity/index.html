<p>I’m sure plenty of you are familiar with the general process of making a game. It’s a lot of back and forth with the things you’re using to create the game. Many ideas get left on the cutting room floor, many feel they should be there. At the end of the day, it’s common to feel like you’ve lost track of what you’re actually making. There is the rare project which seems to persevere in that front, but usually it just takes time to grind it into submission.</p>
<p>Lost Souls is no exception to the rule. I find many days I feel like I’m running into the darkness with a brick wall somewhere in front of me. There aren’t too many effective ways to get around this feeling without just drudging thru it. At some point the depression and malaise set in and everything feels pointless. Why am I doing this? At what point does this miserable feeling go away?</p>
<p>The difficult thing about discussing this feeling with someone is that they often don’t have any valuable response to it. A few of the common responses I have gotten are either reality denial or reluctant reassurance. Not that either of these responses are malicious in nature, but they’re not exactly productive responses. I’d wager it’s more productive for someone to be an active listener than attempt to solve those issues. A compassionate friend is infinitely more effective than an impromptu online therapist. </p>
<p>The unfortunate fact is that many times game development can be madness inducing. Maybe its the trade off for attempting to make something great, or the nature of the medium. Either way, I continue to have a deep respect for anyone willing to run into the fray knowing these facts.</p>
<p>Take care of yourselves.</p>
