      <description>Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m starting a news letter to add longer form content out there for people who don&amp;rsquo;t want to use Discord all the time!
I plan on writing up things in the news letter a few days earlier than posting on here or in the discord, so if you want to be part of that you can sign up!
The things I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing up are primarily:
 Lost Souls Development &amp;amp; Screenshots / Videos Lost Souls Beta Testing Technical Breakdowns (engine compontents, game system implementations) etc  I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and keep the &amp;ldquo;bloggy&amp;rdquo; aspect out of the newsletters, the sappy stuff will be mostly reserved for here where it&amp;rsquo;s more expected.</description>

      <description>Hey, The last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve been sort of entranced with the idea of road tripping across the US from one coast to the next. It&amp;rsquo;s even on my bucket list. Another part of this trip is that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on film &amp;amp; keeping up with making a documentary across throughout the whole process of making my game Lost Souls. I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing my best to document what I can with what I have.</description>

      <description>One day I’m going to die. This is a universal truth for each and every one of us. The last few weeks before writing this have been rough for me. That’s why I’m writing this, as a message to my future self to recognize where I was and where I’ve gotten to. I encourage everyone to write a bucket list of their own.
Here are the current goals of mine, I won’t remove any, but I will add some if I start to run low.</description>
