      <description>Hey, The last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve been sort of entranced with the idea of road tripping across the US from one coast to the next. It&amp;rsquo;s even on my bucket list. Another part of this trip is that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on film &amp;amp; keeping up with making a documentary across throughout the whole process of making my game Lost Souls. I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing my best to document what I can with what I have.</description>

      <description>One day I’m going to die. This is a universal truth for each and every one of us. The last few weeks before writing this have been rough for me. That’s why I’m writing this, as a message to my future self to recognize where I was and where I’ve gotten to. I encourage everyone to write a bucket list of their own.
Here are the current goals of mine, I won’t remove any, but I will add some if I start to run low.</description>
