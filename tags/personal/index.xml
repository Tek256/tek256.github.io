      <description>I’m gonna go ahead and preface this with I’m not looking for pity or any hand outs.
A few days ago I had a pretty negative life event happen. I’m still breathing and as healthy as I really can be. But my living situation &amp;amp; safety net got pulled out from under me. As a result, I’m lowering the time I allocate for my personal projects in order to look for work / contracts in the meantime to try and build up a safety net.</description>

      <description>One day I’m going to die. This is a universal truth for each and every one of us. The last few weeks before writing this have been rough for me. That’s why I’m writing this, as a message to my future self to recognize where I was and where I’ve gotten to. I encourage everyone to write a bucket list of their own.
Here are the current goals of mine, I won’t remove any, but I will add some if I start to run low.</description>
