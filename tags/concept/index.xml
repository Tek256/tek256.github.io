      <description>For the last few months I’ve been writing out and working on the details of a game I’ve been calling Lost Souls. The idea behind the story is that you’re trapped in purgatory and you don’t know how you got there. There are a few different levels of purgatory that you fight thru, similar to Dante’s Inferno.
All of the concept art and pixel art is being done by the wonderful Jackon LeTourneau, you can find him on twitter: whythecussnot</description>
