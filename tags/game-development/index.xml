      <description>Hey there, I see you&amp;rsquo;ve found this post about my dinky little game engine / library thing!
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in that kind of thing, please check it out and let me know what you think! (Discord or Twitter are good ways of yelling in my general direction)

      <description>I figured enough has changed with Lost Souls over the last 8 months that I should probably write a little update post so people don’t have to wait for me to live stream to ask about it.
What is Lost Souls? Lost Souls is a Top Down (think original Zelda) 2D Action RPG. The goal is to make a game that’s fun to play but hard to master. It doesn’t include many frills, focuses mostly on the combat and pacing.</description>

      <description>Beyond the Void is a dungeon crawler. It has randomly generated dungeons. You can play solo or online. In multiplayer you have 2 main options: You can crawl the dungeon with friends, or control the dungeon to stop them. If you haven’t played the demo already, I suggest you try it out. The demo is free and will always be free.
I’ve been working on the game in conceptual form for over 3 1/2 years now.</description>
