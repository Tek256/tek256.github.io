      <description>Hey there, I see you&amp;rsquo;ve found this post about my dinky little game engine / library thing!
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in that kind of thing, please check it out and let me know what you think! (Discord or Twitter are good ways of yelling in my general direction)
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what astera supports / does:
 Rendering  Batched 2D Rendering Baked Sheet (Tiled or Bounded boxes) Post Processing Effects Custom Particle Simulation   Vector Graphics based User Interface  Supports programmatic input (aka controllers, mouse, keyboard, etc)   Audio  3D Audio Quick Sound Effect playback (OGG Vorbis &amp;amp; WAV) Song / Stream playback (OGG Vorbis (WAV soon))   Assets  ZIP &amp;amp; PAK File Management General asset management   An input system that works Really bad INI File writing &amp;amp; loading  FAQ About the engine Why C99?</description>

      <description>Beyond the Void is a dungeon crawler. It has randomly generated dungeons. You can play solo or online. In multiplayer you have 2 main options: You can crawl the dungeon with friends, or control the dungeon to stop them. If you haven’t played the demo already, I suggest you try it out. The demo is free and will always be free.
I’ve been working on the game in conceptual form for over 3 1/2 years now.</description>
